(23) LimitTo

As of now, no filter or orderby pipes are included in standalone Angular2, so this example demonstrates the LimitTo Pipe instead

@app.ts, line 10: Add imported pipes to @Component via viewBindings parameter

@ex23.html, line 8: “pipe_name: passed value” is a very common syntax for pipes, however custom pipes can be written and aren’t forced to maintain this convention (although it is a good idea to maintain it)
